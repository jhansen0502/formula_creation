"# formula_creation" 
This vba script converts the data-gathering template for liquid melt formulas 
to the required source data format for SQL upload into Oracle EBS.  

It requires that you insert a command button ("commandbutton1") into the template.  Use form 
control rather than ActiveX control.

You also need a userform ("userform1").  The back-end script is provided, but you will create 
form itself.
